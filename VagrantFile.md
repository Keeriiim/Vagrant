# VagrantFile editing  
VagrantFiles are based on ruby script. Indentation is very important.
1. Go to your folder where you have the vagrantfile.  
**Vagrant.configure("2") do |config|** - config is a variable for configuring all settings.  
**#** - Comments out the sentance  
**end** - Ends the script.

2. Remove comment from provider and change ram to 1600.
