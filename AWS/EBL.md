# Intro
AWS ELB (Elastic Load Balancing) is a service that automatically distributes incoming application traffic across multiple targets, such as Amazon EC2 instances, containers, and IP addresses, in multiple Availability Zones.  
ELB offers three types of load balancers: Classic Load Balancer (CLB), Application Load Balancer (ALB), and Network Load Balancer (NLB).

## Classic Load Balancer
- Routes traffic based on either application or network lever information
- Ideal for balancing traffic across multiple Ec2 instances
